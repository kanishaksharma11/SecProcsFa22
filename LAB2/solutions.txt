# Discussion Question 1
$ 256 addresses (for 8-bit ASCII encoding; 128 will also work for 7-bit encoding) need to be flushed at the first step. 

# Discussion Question 2
$ The same attack will not work. We need to create eviction set and use prime+probe to make it work. 

# Discussion Question 3
$ In this attack, the attacked only controlled the offset value and mistrained the branch predictor to leak the secret. 
  If the attacker wants to access kernel memory arbitrarily, it needs to find gadgets in kernel where an array in kernel
  memory is accessed using a user-specified pointer. Although there might be conditional checks on this pointer value, they
  can likely be bypassed through mistraining the branch predictor.
